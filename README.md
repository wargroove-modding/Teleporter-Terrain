# Teleporter-Tile
Adds a usable tile that teleports the unit to any other teleporter on the map regardless of distance. Units on teleporters use the `Teleport` action. Units on teleporters are vulnerable when they end their turn on a teleporter, so players must be careful when teleporting into enemy territory.

Teleporters allow slower units like pikeman, trebuchets and giants to jump to the front lines, allowing those critical units to turn the tide of a battle. Teleporters count as a terrain like any other, and cannot be claimed like structures. This means any unit can teleport into the middle of enemy territory so long as there is not a unit standing on the teleporter.

Teleporters function like roads, on top of giving a -3 defense loss. This means Dragons get a critical against units on teleporters.

Anything that walks on land (plus Koji's drones) can use teleporters.
